# React Express Boilerplate

This is a standard boilerplate for a React app with an Express backend. Sass styling is configured for the front end. MySQL is configured for the backend.

### Documentation 

Documentation for the frameworks used can be found here

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/)

### Getting started

1. Clone the react-express-boilerplate repo
2. Inside the repo, run `npm install`
3. For development, nodemon is used to track and update as changes are made. Run `npm run dev` to start dev mode.
4. For production, run `npm start`

### Changing repository location 

Don't forget to switch the git location to your own repo with `git remote set-url origin {your-repository-url}`. 

You can verify that the change was made by running `git remote -v`. The output should resemble 

```
> origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)
```
